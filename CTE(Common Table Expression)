Today we shall discuss Common Table Expression. Let's see how it works:

1. A CTE(Common Table Expression) is a temporary named result set created from a simple select statement that can be used in a subsequent select statement.
2. We define CTEs by adding a WITH clause directly before select, insert , update, delete or merge statements.
3. The WITH clause can include one or more CTEs seperated by commas.

Syntax:

// CTE syntax
with mycte AS (
select a, b, c from table1
)

select a , c from mycte ; // Main query

Example of Common Table Expression:

WITH my_cte AS (
  select * , avg(amount) over (order by p.customer_id) As "Average_Price",
  count(address_id) over (order by c.customer_id) As "Count" 
  from payment as p
  INNER JOIN customer as c
  on p.customer_id=c.customer_id
)

select first_name, last_name from my_cte ;
