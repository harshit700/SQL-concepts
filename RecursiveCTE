A recursive CTE references itself. It returns the result subset, then it repeatedly(recursively) references itself, and stops when it returns all the results.
A recursive CTE has 3 elements:
  a. Non-recursive term: It's a CTE query definition that forms the base result set of the CTE structure. 
  b. Recursive term: One or more CTE query definitions joined with non-recursive term using UNION or UNION ALL operator.
  c. Termination Check: the recursion stops when no rows are returned from previous iteration.

Syntax:

WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
   CTE_query_definition       -- non-recursive term
   UNION ALL
   recursive_query_definition  -- recursive term
)

select * from cte_name ;
